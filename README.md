# ThreadPoolExecutor4Delphi
Java based ThreadPoolExecutor for Delphi

Hi, Delphi community :)

LMBelo here. I'd like to share my Java based ThreadPoolExecutor. 
It was firstly developed to execute asynchronous tasks and carry on them.
It's in first steps and will get greater with your contribution.

See you.
